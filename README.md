# WolfWave - Apple Music + Twitch Companion 🎵

![WolfWave Banner](banner.jpg)

Your Stream’s Now Playing Companion! WolfWave makes it easy to share what you’re listening to with your community. Show real-time “now playing” info, let your chat ask for the current song, and keep everything secure and lightweight.

Whether you’re streaming, recording, or just vibing, WolfWave helps your audience connect with your music. Keep things simple, fast, and privacy-friendly.

Start your stream with a song, or let your chat discover new music with `!song`. Let’s make sharing your soundtrack effortless!

## Features

- **Real-time Now Playing**: Tracks the current Apple Music song and updates instantly.
- **Twitch Chat Integration**: Responds to `!song`, `!currentsong`, and `!nowplaying` using modern EventSub + Helix (no IRC).
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Broadcast now-playing data to your overlay or tools (ws:// or wss://).
- **Secure by Default**: Credentials are stored in macOS Keychain; no plain-text tokens.

2. Open the project: `make open-xcode`
3. Resolve dependencies: `make update-deps`

### Development Commands

- `make build` — Build the app
- `make clean` — Clean build artifacts
- `make test` — Run tests (if configured)
- `make update-deps` — Resolve SwiftPM dependencies
- `make open-xcode` — Open the Xcode project
- `make env-check` — Check required environment configuration
- `make ci` — CI-friendly build

### Code Quality

This project follows Swift best practices:

- Swift 5.9+ with modern concurrency (async/await)
- SwiftUI for user interfaces
- Separation of concerns across Core/Services/Views
- Secure credential storage via Keychain
- Robust error handling

### Code Quality

- SwiftUI for user interfaces
- Separation of concerns across Core/Services/Views
- Secure credential storage via Keychain
- Robust error handling

```bash
# Build the app
make build

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Resolve SwiftPM dependencies
make update-deps

# Open the Xcode project
make open-xcode

# Check required environment vars (e.g., TWITCH_CLIENT_ID)
make env-check

# CI-friendly: build-only
make ci
```

Notes:

- `make test` will attempt to run tests if a test target exists. If none, it safely no-ops.

## Twitch Chat Bot

The bot is implemented with `TwitchChatService` using Twitch Helix + EventSub (no IRC).

- Connect with saved credentials: `joinChannel(broadcasterID:botID:token:clientID:)` or `connectToChannel(channelName:token:clientID:)`.
- Send chat messages via Helix: `sendMessage(_:)` or `sendMessage(_:replyTo:)`.
- Supply current track info for commands: set `getCurrentSongInfo` on the service.
- Commands can be toggled in Settings (“Bot Commands” → “Current Song”).
- The service respects `commandsEnabled` so you can disable all commands from Settings.

### Bot Command Architecture

- Commands live under `Services/Twitch/Commands`.
- `BotCommand` protocol defines `triggers`, `description`, and `execute(message:)`.
- `SongCommand` handles `!song`, `!currentsong`, and `!nowplaying` and calls the injected `getCurrentSongInfo` closure.
- `BotCommandDispatcher` wires commands together and is used inside `TwitchChatService`.

### Adding a New Command (example)

```swift
final class HelloCommand: BotCommand {
    let triggers = ["!hello"]
    let description = "Greets the chatter"

    func execute(message: String) -> String? {
        let trimmed = message.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces).lowercased()
        return trimmed.hasPrefix("!hello") ? "Hello, chat!" : nil
    }
}
```

Register it in `BotCommandDispatcher.registerDefaultCommands()` by instantiating and calling `register(_:)`. Add any Settings toggle before enabling it by default.

## Security

- WebSocket tokens, Twitch OAuth tokens, and Twitch bot usernames are stored in Keychain
- Tokens are not written to UserDefaults or disk in plain text
